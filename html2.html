        <p>
            I was worried, I was stressed<br>
            How did it even feel to be blessed<br>
            I had forgotten the peace inside<br>
            My heart, my chest felt really tight<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            But then I asked for help to God<br>
            Desparate, but with all the faith I got<br>
            I looked up to find a clue<br>
            What I saw was nothing new<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            What I saw was just a regular cloud<br>
            Nothing special, nothing to talk about<br>
            But I noticed how it was floating there<br>
            Against a background of just bluish air<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            While the cloud hid the sun from sight<br>
            It kept moving abd soon I saw the light<br>
            Now that the floating cloud has moved away<br>
            And I see the brightest light of day<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            And here I became suddenly aware<br>
            That my stressers and worries were still there<br>
            The cloud however made me see<br>
            That these problems will not forever be with me<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Solutions I will search for and I will see the light<br>
            And my heart became calm, it will be all right<br>
        </p>
